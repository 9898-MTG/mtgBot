Rules
  Each player chooses 3 booster pack styles between either historic draft booster or standard draft booster.

  A standard booster pack will generate whatever the sets are in the current rotation of the standard format and from those generates 1 basic land, 10 commons, 3 uncommons, and 1 rare or mythic rare.

  A standard draft booster pack will generate whatever the sets are in the current rotation of the standard format and from those generates 10 commons, 4 uncommons, and 1 rare or mythic rare.

  A historic booster pack will generate from any sets and from those generates 1 basic land, 10 commons, 3 uncommons, and 1 rare or mythic rare.

  A historic draft booster pack will generate from an y sets and from those generates 10 commons, 4 uncommons, and 1 rare or mythic rare.

  Click the appropiate decision on the booster pack generator to generate 1 booster pack each time clicked. Drag a box around the cards generated to highlight them then press G on the keyboard to group them.

  Repeat this process until all players have 3 packs generated.

  Players will then save the cards as an object to be their Inventory! DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP!

  Players then begin to create a minimum deck including basic lands of 40 cards. Again DO NOT FORGET TO SAVE YOUR INVENTORY!

  You will not be able to edit your deck after this step until you are told that you may do so.

  Once all players have saved their inventory with a starting deck and any extra cards, the Game Board phase now begins.

  From the Unmarked Boards, shuffle and drag one out for it to begin as the starting game board.

  Each board has its own rules and a rule notecard!

  After moving on a game board, you do the tile corresponding deck effect first!
  After that effect has resolved, then you must use the random encounter generator!

  Players start with 1000 Gold and 10 Mana Link known as life.

  Further instructions will be written soon!

  This game must be used with the generator at the website:

Find your opponent’s base camp before they find yours!</p>  <p>GET READY:</p>  <p>Open three packs, give one basic land to each player, then remove any remaining land cards and any cards without Magic card backs. Shuffle the remaining cards together and deal 11 cards to each player.</p>  <p>Each player then looks at their cards and arranges them face down in a 4x3 grid opposite their opponent.

The first player to finish their grid goes first.</p>  <p>LET’S PLAY:</p>  <p>On their turn, each player moves one of their cards one space either vertically or horizontally—not diagonally, and not onto a space occupied by another card they own.</p>  <p>You can use your turn to move a card safely onto an</p>               </div> </div>        <h1 class="card-text-title" lang="en">           <span class="card-text-card-name">               Base Race (cont'd)           </span> </h1>        <p class="card-text-type-line" lang="en">           Card </p>          <div class="card-text-box" lang="en">               <div class="card-text-oracle">                 <p>empty space. Moving a card onto a space occupied by an opponent’s card starts a battle! Reveal both cards and do the following for each card type:</p>  <p>If both revealed cards are Creatures/Artifact Creatures, the card with the higher toughness wins and remains face up; the loser is discarded. If they tie, the attacker wins.</p>  <p>Legendary Creatures/Planeswalkers always win against nonlegendary creatures. When they battle each other, the higher toughness or loyalty wins. If they tie, the attacker wins.</p>  <p>If either of the revealed cards is an Instant/Sorcery/Enchantment, discard both revealed cards. <i>(Other effects still happen.)</i></p>  <p>If one of the revealed cards is an Artifact, the player who owns it discards it and takes an extra turn. If both revealed cards are Artifacts, only the attacker gets the extra turn.</p>  <p>TO WIN:</p>  <p>When a Land is revealed in battle, its owner loses the game.

Using other cards as clues, discover all the facts about your opponent’s mystery card.</p>  <p>GET READY:</p>  <p>Randomly determine who goes first—that player is the Secretkeeper, and their opponent is the Detective. First, the Secretkeeper opens a pack and removes any lands and cards without Magic card backs. Next, they shuffle the remaining cards and pick one at random. That card is the mystery card. Finally, the Secretkeeper gives the Detective the rest of the cards, and the game begins.</p>  <p>LET’S PLAY:</p>  <p>The Detective must correctly guess four facts</p>               </div> </div>        <h1 class="card-text-title" lang="en">           <span class="card-text-card-name">               Booster Sleuth (cont'd)           </span> </h1>        <p class="card-text-type-line" lang="en">           Card </p>          <div class="card-text-box" lang="en">               <div class="card-text-oracle">                 <p>about the mystery card: converted mana cost, color, card type, and the number of words in its name.

// START Of MTG Objects
// mtgObjects
//  description
//    <p>An object is almost any concrete "thing" in a game of Magic: an ability on the stack, a card, a copy of a card, a token, a spell, a permanent, or an emblem. However, players are not objects, nor are counters, damage, and many other concepts that apply to objects. No card currently references objects as such, only particular types of objects.<p>An object can have many characteristics: Name, mana cost, color, card type, subtype, supertype, rules text, abilities, power and toughness, loyalty, hand modifier and life modifier. Any other information regarding the object is not considered a characteristic, but rather an attribute, a property or a quality.
//   Rules
//     From the glossary of the Comprehensive Rules (June 7, 2024—Modern Horizons 3)

//     Object
//     An ability on the stack, a card, a copy of a card, an emblem, a token, a spell, or a permanent. See rule 109, “Objects.”
//     From the Comprehensive Rules (June 7, 2024—Modern Horizons 3)

//     109. Objects
//     109.1. An object is an ability on the stack, a card, a copy of a card, a token, a spell, a permanent, or an emblem.
//     109.2. If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes a card type or subtype, but doesn’t refer to a specific zone or include the word “card,” “spell,” “source,” or “scheme,” it means a permanent of that card type or subtype on the battlefield.
//     109.2a If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes the word “card” and the name of a zone, it means a card matching that description in the stated zone.
//     109.2b If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes the word “spell,” it means a spell matching that description on the stack.
//     109.2c If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes the word “source,” it means a source matching that description—a source of an ability, of damage, or of mana—in any zone. See rules 113.7 and 609.7.
//     109.2d If an ability of a scheme card includes the text “this scheme,” it means the scheme card in the command zone on which that ability is printed.
//     109.3. An object’s characteristics are name, mana cost, color, color indicator, card type, subtype, supertype, rules text, abilities, power, toughness, loyalty, defense, hand modifier, and life modifier. Objects can have some or all of these characteristics. Any other information about an object isn’t a characteristic. For example, characteristics don’t include whether a permanent is tapped, a spell’s target, an object’s owner or controller, what an Aura enchants, and so on.
//     109.4. Only objects on the stack or on the battlefield have a controller. Objects that are neither on the stack nor on the battlefield aren’t controlled by any player. See rule 108.4. There are six exceptions to this rule:
//     109.4a The controller of a mana ability is determined as though it were on the stack. See rule 605, “Mana Abilities.”
//     109.4b A triggered ability that has triggered but is waiting to be placed on the stack is controlled by the player who controlled its source at the time it triggered, unless it’s a delayed triggered ability. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules 603.7d–f. See also rule 603, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”
//     109.4c An emblem is controlled by the player who puts it into the command zone. See rule 114, “Emblems.”
//     109.4d In a Planechase game, a face-up plane or phenomenon card is controlled by the player designated as the planar controller. This is usually the active player. See rule 901.6.
//     109.4e In a Vanguard game, each vanguard card is controlled by its owner. See rule 902.6.
//     109.4f In an Archenemy game, each scheme card is controlled by its owner. See rule 904.7.
//     109.4g In a Conspiracy Draft game, each conspiracy card is controlled by its owner. See rule 905.5.
//     109.5. The words “you” and “your” on an object refer to the object’s controller, its would-be controller (if a player is attempting to play, cast, or activate it), or its owner (if it has no controller). For a static ability, this is the current controller of the object it’s on. For an activated ability, this is the player who activated the ability. For a triggered ability, this is the controller of the object when the ability triggered, unless it’s a delayed triggered ability. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules 603.7d–f.
//     Characteristic
//     From the glossary of the Comprehensive Rules (June 7, 2024—Modern Horizons 3)

//     Characteristics
//     Information that defines an object. See rule 109.3.

physicalMutations
  An evil rune, such as the symbol of a demon lord or archdevil, appears on your face.
  Your eyes become a glossy black.
  Demonic-looking horns sprout from your forehead.
  You become wizened and hideous, looking almost like a mummified corpse.
  You lose all facial features, your former face being covered with smooth skin.
  You gain a forked tongue.
  You lose your nose and instead gain slit-like nostrils.
  You become almost skeletal, with white skin, no hair, and a gaunt stature.
  Your shadow seems darker and bigger than before. Sometimes it moves out of sync with your body.
  You appear superficially very attractive, but some people are revolted by you (sort of like psychopath sense).
  Your teeth become sharp points.
  Your nails grow longer and longer, and are impossible to cut.
  A small black spot appears somewhere on your body and grows.
  Your heart is turned to stone and you are unable to feel emotion.
  You are unable to withstand direct sunlight.
  You shed your skin all at once like a reptile and are vulnerable for a short period afterwards (alternatively, you build a cocoon and transform into... something else).
  You have an affinity with a type of bug like a cockroach, which you may eat, play with, see often, or which may emerge from your bodily orifices.
  Animals instinctively know you are evil/wrong.
  Plants that you touch wither and rot.
  Your eyes grow to be more bulbous, similar to a fish.
  One of your hands losses all bones and shifts into a writhing mass of tentacles.
  You begin to develop patches of only black scales that are contantly itchy. When scratched off, more grow to take their place.
  Your teeth shift in your mouth to sit at odd angles. This doesn't impact your ability to talk or eat, but it does five you a crooked smile.
  You begin to sweat a thin, clear grease. No matter how much you bathe you cannot get it off.
  Two new eyes grow in the palms of your hands. You cannot see out of them and they seem to move on their own freewill.
  Your spine arches outwards, giving you a severe hunchback. Looking closer reveals small spines protruding from your skin down your back.
  The palms of your hands are stained a deep red that is not able to be washed off.
  Your skin becomes cold and rubbery to the touch.
  Blood will occasionally leak out of various spots on your head (eyes, ears, nose, mouth). It is not enough to hurt you, but it is visible to others.
  Your body odor becomes that of brimstone, rotting fish, or rotting flesh.
  Your body temperature is always burning hot or freezing cold.
  Your eye pupils change (cat eyes, frog eyes, goat eyes, multiple pupils, no pupils, etc.).
  Your eyes glow with a hellish light.
  Your eyes change to empty sockets filled with absolute darkness or hellish light.
  You grow one or multiple extra eyes (extra set, third eye, randomly placed eye).
  You gain a halo of fire or hellish light.
  Your skin color changes to something unnatural for your race (green, milk white, obsidian black, red, etc.).
  Your skin changes to scales (if you didn't have scales before).
  Your skin stretches and bulges as if there is something moving beneath it.
  Your teeth become shark-like, with extra rows of teeth.
  There is a literal gaping hole in your chest where your heart used to be.
  The touch of blessed, divine, or sacred objects burn you and leave actual burn marks.
  Your veins become visible through your skin; they might appear black, blue, green, red, or glowing.
  Your reflection shows a monster.
  Your shadow is shaped like that of a monster.
  Your fingers lose their bones, especially where you held the Evil Object. They still move just fine and may even gain some flexibility.
  Your pupils appear to be constantly melting off your face in a jelly-like trail of black slime.
  Your mouth moves to your clavicle overnight and expands across the entire front of your throat as though your throat has been slit.
  You no longer gain sustenance from food or recuperate from rest. You begin to lose 1 permanent HP per day until the problem is solved or curse is lifted. Becoming an undead or aberration or finding alternative sources of nourishment may help you.
  When breathing out in cold weather, you exhale black smoke instead of white breath.
  You have no shadow. Even the natural shading of your body is gone, giving you an uncanny valley kind of appearance.
  Your blood loses all colour, your complexion is now unnaturally pale and ashy.
  Strange runes in a language foreign to you appear on random spots on your body. They appear to be trying to tell you somethig but you cannot descipher them.
  Shadows cling to your body, and aren't as easily dispelled by light.
  Anomalous orifices begin appearing on your body, such as mouths, eye sockets, etc.
  A tragedy/comedy masks appears over your face, which bleeds a black liquid from its openings.
  Your eyes are now tinted with a dull black, as if dampened. When you cry, it's almost as if the tears share the same color as your original eyes.
  Wisps of black smoke sift through the soles of your shoes whenever you walk.
  Whenever you voice echoes, it lasts for much longer than it normally should.
  Acts of humanity and decency now stain you. Tears apply permanent defects to your skin. Mercy and sparing aches your hand, and dimples become gnarly and wrinkled.
  Your presence dampens the weave around you, snuffing out simple cantrip effects such as dancing lights, prestidigitation, and mending.
  You hear the pulses of those near you. The heavy thuds of their hearts beat like drums drowning out ambient sounds.
  A loud crash shakes the establishment. It appears lightning struck the rooftop. This is the third time this week it’s happened while you were out and about.
  Your wrists can rotate all the way around.
  You slowly stop needing to move your mouth to talk.
  Amalgamation. You look like several parts from different creatures were spiced, stitched, or grown together to from one creature.
  Disproportional limbs. Ex: one overly large arm or one overly small leg.
  Strange bulbous pods growing on your skin. They seem to pulsate with your heart beat.
  When cut, you bleed black or green ichor instead of blood.
  When your skin gets damaged, it reveals a different type of creature underneath. This other creature appears to be wearing your skin like a disguise.
  Everybody who sees your eyes will believe that you are looking directly at them. (like it is with the mona lisa).
  Your skin turns clean and pure white. It's hard to the touch and slightly cold.
  An eye appears on the back of your neck. It's a bright acidic greenish yellow color.
  A strange symbol appears in the middle of the chest of whatever clothing you wear. If you put a coat over it, the symbol fades in on the surface of the coat over the course of a few minutes. If you take the coat off, it fades and is back on the shirt underneath again. When you strip naked, it fades in as a tattoo.
  Your hair becomes distressed and wirey no matter how much you tend to it, creating a knotted nest of bristly strands.
  Your saliva takes on an unnatural hue and can now be used as a weak venom.
  You gain a wheezing, hacking cough that eventually leads to strange objects and fluids being coughed up (I.e. tetromas, small statues and smoothed rocks, black sludge).
  You weep black, oily tears.
  Strange shapes begin to form beneath your skin, spelling out words as you run your fingers over them. The words urge you to commit dreadful acts.
  A hornet's nest forms within your body. The hornets come and go through holes at your collar bones. They are not hostile to you.
  While your appearance does not change, it becomes increasingly difficult for others to remember who you are. Over time, even your closest friends and family lose the ability to recognize or remember you.
  Your fingernails shed and regrow constantly. The process is neither clean nor painless.
  You develop a chronic irritation, such as itchy eyes, sore limbs/joints, or a mild rash. Careful observers will notice a very subtle movement at the location, akin to a worm moving under the surface.
  Your gait shifts as you move, most times in small increments similar to carrying a heavy object in a hand or dragging with a leg, but sometimes the shift is like some large entity actively pushing/pulling against you.
  Your body's symmetry is thrown askew. One arm is thicker, an eye is larger, a leg is now 1-2 inches longer/shorter, etc. This change affects 1d3 paired body parts or organs.
  A natural aura of darkness follows you. People always (mysteriously) find themselves standing in your shadow, a cloud passes over the sun/moon, or another person/object blocks the nearest light source when you get close.
  Your hair becomes overgrown and filthy quickly, and clumps come out effortlessly, but your hair never thins.
  You regularly regurgitate wads of hair, teeth, and toenail.
  When others look at their reflection in your eyes they see the moment of their own death.
  When you speak a second lower voice comes from your throat repeating the same words but in a croaking, droning melody.
  You seemingly aren't affected by wind. Your hair and clothes do not move in light winds, but you will still be affected by severe weather. (Alternatively, you and anything you're wearing are always blowing in wind).
  You no longer make noise breathing, coughing, sneezing, from your pulse, yawning, or from objects hitting you. You still make noise walking and verbally.
  You're facial features become more severe. Your jaw becomes more angular and long, you cheekbones become abnormally large, your forehead protrudes like a neanderthal, and your nose grows larger. Additionally, your fingers and toes grow longer.
  Your skin becomes slightly translucent, so your muscle tissue is visible. Optionally, your muscles are also clear, so you can see your bones.
  When you wake up from sleeping/trance etc. Your mouth is sewn shut, and your jaw is unable to open. The wire holding your mouth shut is durable, and takes 2d4 minutes to cut. Whenever you re-awaken, this happens again.
  The skin directly above your veins turns dark purple, perfectly tracing them. Your veins also protrude more. When you bleed, the veins in that area become black.
  You no longer need to blink nor close your eyes when you sleep. (You still have the awareness when sleeping that you would if your eyes were closed, though.) Your eyes become incredibly bloodshot and get worse every hour after you awaken.
  Your skin looks red and irritated, and you are hot to the touch. Any tears or sweat evaporates in a few seconds. When your blood is spilt, it appears to be boiling. The area around wounds that bleed blisters.
  Your skin becomes shiny, smooth, and is hard to the touch. When you are damaged, your skin cracks like ceramic. It still heals at its normal rate, but the materials needed to heal you without magic change. Your skin has permanent scratches unless healed magically.
  Your eye lashes turn into spider legs. They seem to move with a mind of their own. When one is pulled out it grows back in 2d4 hours.

  fighting: Competence in unarmed combat.
  climbing: Scaling various surfaces.
  contortion: Escaping from otherwise secure physical bonds by twisting, writhing, and contorting the body.
  dodge: Slipping out of danger’s way, whether avoiding an attack or a sprung booby trap.
  flying: Maneuvering under one’s own power (such as with wings).
  jumping: Leaping over obstacles.
  melee combat: Wielding hand-to-hand weapons.
  riding: Controlling and riding domesticated mounts.
  stealth: Moving silently and avoiding detection, whether through shadows or crowds.
  charioteering: Accelerating, steering, and decelerating chariots (in particular) or any kind of cart-and-animal vehicle.
  lockpicking: Opening a mechanical lock without possessing the key or combination.
  marksmanship: Shooting any kind of mechanical device — such as a bow or sling — that projects missiles across a distance.
  pilotry: Operating any water-faring vehicle, including steering, applying the oars, or managing the sails.
  sleight of hand: Nimbleness with the fingers and misdirection, including picking pockets, palming items, and stage magic.
  throwing: Hitting a target accurately with a thrown item, including stones, javelins, bottles, and knives. Also used for catching thrown items.
  lifting: Moving or lifting heavy objects, as well as representing the ability to inflict additional damage with strength-powered weapons.
  running: Moving quickly on the ground while avoiding obstacles and keeping from stumbling.
  stamina: Physical endurance and resistance to pain, disease, and poison.
  swimming: Moving and surviving in a liquid medium.
  cultures: Comprehension of customs, traditions, art, history, politics, and views on outsiders of various regions or groups, as well as the ability to generalize about common cultural forms.
  devices: Using and designing complex mechanical equipment. Actually building items requires crafting.
  healing: Dressing wounds, applying splints, and disinfecting injuries, plus an understanding and application of medical procedures, such as diagnosing illnesses and performing surgery.
  navigation: Determining the correct course using external reference points, such as stars, maps, or landmarks, as well as creating maps.
  reading/writing: Familiarity with and ability to understand various forms of written communication, as well as the ability to create literary compositions, including forging papers and identifying such forgeries. Characters do not begin with the ability to read or write
  scholar: This skill represents knowledge and/or education in areas not covered under any other skill (such as alchemy, cooking, arcane lore, etc.). This may be restricted to a specific field (represented by specializations) or a general knowledge of a wide range of subjects. It is used to remember details, rumors, tales, legends, theories, important people, and the like, as appropriate for the subject in question. However, the broader the category, the fewer the details that can be recalled. It covers what the character himself can recall. Having another skill as a specialization of the scholar skill means that the character knows the theories and history behind the skill but can’t actually use it. Scholar can be useful with investigation to narrow a search for information.
  speaking: Familiarity with and ability to understand various forms of verbal communication. Characters know the Trade Speech (assuming the setting has one) and one “native” language in which they have spoken fluency. Additional languages in which a character has proficiency can be represented by specializations of this skill.
  trading: Knowledge of business practices, exchange rates, the monetary value of goods and opportunities, and other information regarding barter and sales, including the ability to determine how to make money with another skill the character has. Trading can complement bluff, charm, and persuasion when haggling over prices for goods and services being bought or sold.
  traps: Installing, altering, and bypassing security devices, as well as identifying various kinds of traps (gas, pit, wire-triggered, etc.).
  artist: Making works of art, like paintings, music compositions, and dance choreographies.
  crafting: Creating, fixing, or modifying equipment, weapons, armor, and vehicles, as well as woodworking, metalworking, constructing buildings, and the like.
  disguise: Altering features or clothing to be unrecognizable or to look like someone else. Also useful in acting performances.
  gambling: Playing and cheating at games of strategy and luck.
  hide: Concealing objects, both on oneself and using camouflage.
  investigation: Gathering information, researching topics, analyzing data, and piecing together clues.
  know-how: Figuring out how to perform an action in which the character does not have experience, as well as a catch-all skill encompassing areas not covered by other skills (such as utilitarian sewing or cooking).
  search: Spotting hidden objects or people, reconnoitering, lipreading, or eavesdropping on or watching another person.
  streetwise: Finding information, goods, and contacts in an urban environment, particularly through thieves’ guilds and similar criminal organizations, black markets, and other illicit operations. Also useful for determining possible motives and methods of criminals.
  survival: Surviving in wilderness environments, including the ability to identify plants, animals, and their nutritional and medicinal uses.
  tracking: Following the trail of another person, animal, or creature, or keeping after a moving target without being noticed.
  animal handling: Controlling animals and making them perform tricks and follow commands.
  bluff: Lying, tricking, or deceiving others, as well as verbal evasion, misdirection, and blustering. Disguise can complement uses of this skill. Also useful in putting on acting performances.
  charm: Using friendliness, flattery, or seduction to influence someone else. Also useful in sales and bartering transactions, putting on performances (such as singing, acting, or storytelling), and situations involving etiquette.
  command: Effectively ordering and coordinating others in team situations.
  intimidation: Using physical presence, verbal threats, taunts, torture, or fear to influence others or get information out of them.
  mettle: Ability to withstand stress, temptation, other people’s interaction attempts, mental attacks, and pain. The Game Master may allow a specialization in a specific faith tradition or belief system to enhance many, though not all, applications of mettle.
  persuasion: Influencing others or getting information out of them through bribery, honest discussion, debate, diplomacy, or speeches. Also useful in negotiations, business transactions, storytelling, and oration.

  Embalm When you cast a spell with Cascade, exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card whose mana value is less than the cascading spell. You may cast that card without paying its mana cost. Then put all cards exiled this way that weren't cast on the bottom of your library in a random order
  Provoke (Whenever this creature attacks, you may have target creature defending player controls untap and block it if able.)
